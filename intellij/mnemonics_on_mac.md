# [WIP] Mnemonics on mac

For people who could do without mnemonics (and using Macs obviously), generate a new keyboard layout [here][here] with the option "Yes, but leave the "option" keystrokes blank" selected. Use this keyboard layout by adding it under the "Input Sources" section in Keyboard preferences.

What this gives you is the ability to use most (IDEA-214521) of the "alt + <character>" shortcuts without the mnemonics.
