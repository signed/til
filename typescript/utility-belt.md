A bunch of libraries found on the web that I found interesting.
Not necessarily tried them yet.

## [immer.js](https://github.com/immerjs/immer)
Small library that helps with patching immutable data structures like you have to do in a react reducer.

## [list](https://github.com/funkia/list)
List is a purely functional alternative to arrays. It is an implementation of a fast persistent sequence data structure.

## [purify](https://github.com/gigobyte/purify)
Purify is a library for functional programming in TypeScript. It's purpose is to allow developers to use popular patterns and abstractions that are available in most functional languages. It is also Fantasy Land conformant.
