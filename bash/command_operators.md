# Command operators

* `|` pipes (pipelines) the standard output (`stdout`) of one command into the standard input of another one.
  Note that `stderr` still goes into its default destination, whatever that happen to be.
* `|&`pipes both `stdout` and `stderr` of one command into the standard input of another one.
  Very useful, available in bash version 4 and above.
* `&&` executes the right-hand command of `&&` only if the previous one succeeded.
* `||` executes the right-hand command of `||` only it the previous one failed.
* `;` executes the right-hand command of `;` always regardless whether the previous command succeeded or failed.
  Unless `set -e` was previously invoked, which causes `bash` to fail on an error.
